gauss-2d
========

Assune one have two-dimentional gaussian distribution on a form:

 **f(x,y) = Gaus(x| 0, sigma_x)* Gaus(y| 0, sigma_y)**.

No correlation is assumed between **x** and **y**.

(x,y)-plane is devided on:
  1. Circle with radius **r0**.
  2. Ring with inner radius of **r0** and outer radius of **r1**.
  3. Another ring with inner radius **r1** and the outer one of **r2**.

Rings are divided into quadrants by x and y axes.

**Question:** Which sizes of **r0**, **r1** and **r2** should be that:
  * Circle contains 50% off distribution$:
  * 1st ring --- 40%:
  * 2nd ring --- 9.9%,
Which fraction each quadrant will contain?
